          While we offer a wide range of products, we place strong emphasis on curation. We identify fashion-forward brands, vetting for style and quality, and further select styles within these brands to offer. We also place importance on selling full-price products, reducing reliance on discounting, and selling the latest seasonâ€™s designs. In addition, we use digital content, personalized mobile application experiences and proprietary recommendation algorithms, to build differentiated style-driven, discovery-led experiences for consumers.
